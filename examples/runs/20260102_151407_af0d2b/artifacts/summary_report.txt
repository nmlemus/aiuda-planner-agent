HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION - FINAL SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Task: Predict house sale prices using machine learning
Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on log-transformed prices
Dataset: 1,460 training samples, 1,459 test samples
Original Features: 79 features (36 numeric, 43 categorical)

DATA PREPROCESSING
------------------
1. Missing Value Handling:
   - Categorical NAs treated as "None" for features like Pool, Fence, etc.
   - Numeric NAs filled with median values
   - All missing values successfully handled

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Created 12 new features:
     * TotalSF (total square footage)
     * TotalBathrooms (combined bathroom count)
     * TotalPorchSF (total porch area)
     * Binary indicators (HasPool, HasGarage, HasBsmt, etc.)
     * Age features (HouseAge, RemodAge, GarageAge)
     * OverallScore (quality × condition)

3. Feature Transformation:
   - Log transformation applied to 27 highly skewed features
   - Target variable (SalePrice) log-transformed for better distribution
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables (270 features after encoding)

FEATURE SELECTION (BORUTA)
---------------------------
- Algorithm: Boruta with Random Forest
- Features Selected: 21 out of 270 features (92% reduction)
